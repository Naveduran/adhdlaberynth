# ADHD Laberynth

Your brain is not a rock.

It changes every day so you can learn things and improve your performance. Playing with this [labyrinth](https://naveduran.github.io/adhdlaberynth/) can help you to improve common symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD):

- Attention

- Visual processing

- Problem solving

- Concentration

- Impulse control

- Decision-making

## Brain

Neuroscience has shown the frontal cortex allows us to sustain attention and inhibit the automatic response to stimuli, specifically the orbitofrontal and dorsolateral frontal cortex.

Playing with [labyrinths](https://naveduran.github.io/adhdlaberynth/) is recommended for people with difficulties controlling impulsive behavior and avoiding distraction, for example, people with TDAH symptoms.
